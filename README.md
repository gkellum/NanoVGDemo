# NanoVGDemo
NanoVG is small antialiased vector graphics rendering library for OpenGL available on github at https://github.com/memononen/nanovg.  
This is a port of the NanoVG OSX and iOS demos that runs in Xcode using Swift and Cocoa instead of using the GLFW for creating 
native windows and setting up the OpenGL environment.
